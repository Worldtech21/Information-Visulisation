# Information Visualization: COVID-19's Impact on the Environment

## Overview

This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality, visualizing the interplay between infection rates and environmental conditions over time. By integrating datasets on air quality and COVID-19 cases, we aim to uncover patterns and insights into how lockdowns and other measures affected environmental factors.

## Data Sources

- **Delhi Air Quality Index Data**: [AQICN Delhi](https://aqicn.org/city/delhi)
- **COVID-19 India Data**: [COVID-19 India](https://data.covid19india.org/)

**Note**: The official API for COVID-19 data has been deprecated due to Indian Government regulations. However, extensive datasets remain available on the provided website, sourced authentically from multiple channels.

## Data Description

The project includes a Gephi file that combines two datasets:
- **COVID-19 Data**
- **Air Quality Index Data**

Both datasets cover the period from January 30, 2020, to October 31, 2021. They have been preprocessed and aligned by date for analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Download and Install Gephi**: If you haven't already, install Gephi on your system to explore the data.
2. **Load the Gephi File**: Import the provided Gephi file to visualize the data.
3. **Explore the Data**: Investigate the connections between air quality and COVID-19 cases. Notice how fluctuations in air quality may correspond with changes in infection rates.

## Insights

Through this visualization, you can observe how air quality fluctuated in tandem with the number of positive COVID-19 cases reported daily. This can offer valuable insights into the environmental impacts of pandemic-related restrictions and behaviors.
